Password Generator Assignment
## Purpose
## My Experience
The first thing I did was opening the index file with a live server and checked the console. Upon checking the console, I saw an error with the the  generatePassword being undefined. I defined it in the global scope as a string variable (empty). I then began to define the function that was being called in the var password on line 11. 

I then wrote a pseudocode as line comments at the end of my javascript page in order to break down the assignment into smaller pieces.
