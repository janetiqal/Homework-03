Password Generator Assignment
## Purpose
## My Experience
The first thing I did was write pseudocode as line comments at the end of my javascript page in order to break down the assignment into smaller pieces. I found I need to write multiple functions in order to achieve the simplest results. 

I opened the index file with a live server and checked the console. Upon checking the console, I saw an error with the the  generatePassword being undefined. I then began to define the function that was being called in the var password on line 11. 

I wrote the function for generatePassword to determine the character length of the password. The password must be a length of 8 to 128 characters. If the user types in a number less than 8 or more than 128 a prompt message shows up in the browser and alerts the user of their error. The function also warns the user to pick a number and not any other character.
